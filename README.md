# lsh-go

Locality sensitive hashing lib for golang

## Supported methods

### Minhash

In the first iteration only CSHAKE based minhash algorithm is supported.
Using CHAKE customization we can easily make a bunch of hash functions and use them for calculating minhash.

## TODO

- Add examples for every hash method
- Add more info here about locality sensitive hashing
- Add some tests
- [TLSH](https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh) support
